[h1]About[/h1]

[b]Project Choronymy[/b] (aka [b]More Immersive Rosetta[/b]) is an opinionated patch that aims to make [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2255229872]Immersive Toponyms[/url], [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2217534250]More Cultural Names[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2233777492]Rosetta[/url] compatible.
All of these mods do a similar thing: they [b]change the name of holdings on the map depending on the culture of their holder[/b]. They all tackle different areas of the map and use a different approach to doing this however, meaning that while there is value in using all of them at the same time, they are incompatible by default. This mod makes it possible to use them in conjunction.

[h1]Features[/h1]
Any title will try to pick its cultural name from [b]Rosetta[/b] first, then [b]More Cultural Names[/b] then [b]Immersive Toponyms[/b] and finally vanilla if possible.
[list]
[*] [b]413536[/b] cultural names come from [b]Immersive Toponyms[/b]
[*] [b]151705[/b] cultural names come from [b]MCN[/b]
[*] [b]99302[/b] cultural names come from [b]Rosetta[/b]
[*] [b]3[/b] are vanilla entries!
[/list]

This mod being generated automatically also means that it makes it possible to use the 3 other mods even if they are outdated, as long as this patch is present!

For example, at the time of writing this, Rosetta is only updated for 1.7.1 and the latest version of the game is 1.8, but this patch makes sure that there are no incompatibilies and that using Rosetta on this version of the game does not cause any issue.

[h1]Load Order[/h1]

Your load order should only include Project Choronymy (this mod), preceded by Immersive Toponyms which this mod relies on to get some fonts. However, [b]please subscribe to the other mods[/b] this mod uses. It would not exist if these other ones did not.

[i]NOTE[/i]: At the time of writing this, activating Rosetta will cause your court names to be named "Royal Court of TITLE_DEFINITIVE_NAME". In order to bypass this issue, simply deactivate Rosetta in your load order.

Your load order should end up looking like:
